'''
Purpose of Program:
    Implement different forms of algorithm design to the
    0-1 knapsack problem. Used backtracking, greedy, randomized, and dynamic
    algorithms to solve the same problem but slightly different in each occasion. Then compare
    the different running times of each with different weights, values, and capacities.
